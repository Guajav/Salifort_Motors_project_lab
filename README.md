# Salifort_Motors_project_lab

# Project Description

This project addresses Salifort's employee turnover issue, involving voluntary departures and terminations, 
focusing on the 'left' y-value. The project aims to understand the key drivers behind this 
attrition problem, which has raised concerns among senior leadership, affecting corporate 
culture, employee development, and financial costs. Given Salifort's substantial investments 
in employee recruitment, training, and skill enhancement, it is crucial to identify the 
underlying factors. By analyzing data related to job satisfaction, tenure, performance 
evaluations, project engagement, and monthly work hours, this analysis employs Random Forest-
modeling to identify the top 10 determinants of employee turnover. Job satisfaction emerges as 
the most significant influence, followed by tenure, performance evaluations, project engagement,
and monthly work hours. To gain deeper insights into job satisfaction, a comprehensive survey involving-
-current and former employees is initiated. The analysis highlights the superior predictive performance of 
Random Forest cross-validation compared to the Logistic Regression model, with moderate 
enhancements over the Decision Tree cross-validation. These findings empower Salifort to 
proactively address the issue by elevating job satisfaction, fostering data-informed 
decision-making, and ultimately improving corporate culture while curtailing significant 
financial outlays.
